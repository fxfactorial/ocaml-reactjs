OCaml bindings to ReactJS

These are OCaml bindings to ReactJS. This means that you write OCaml
and compile to JavaScript using the js_of_ocaml compiler.

with just:

$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package reactjs -linkpkg code.ml
$ js_of_ocaml a.out -o from_ocaml.js

See the github homepage for working code examples and check the
wiki for common questions.

Also check https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-mailing-list for
a self contained and working example of rendering ReactJS on node
by also using OCaml bindings to nodejs.
