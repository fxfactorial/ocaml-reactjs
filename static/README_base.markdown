ReactJS bindings in OCaml
=========================

These are my bindings to ReactJS, by my count this is the global sixth
attempt at binding to React and my own second attempt, its kind of
hard.

Installation
============

Right now you can install with:

```shell
$ opam pin add -y reactjs https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-reactjs
```

The bindings should work on `node` or in the browser, both will assume
that `React`, and `ReactDOM` exist (on node they will do the
appropriate `require`, node side will also try to load the npm package
`react-dom-server`)

Examples
========

These examples should be familiar and are autogenerated into this
README from under the `reactjs_based_examples` dir.

Compiles any example with:

```shell
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package reactjs -linkpkg code.ml
$ js_of_ocaml a.out -o code.js
```

for more example source code, include how to render on the server with
`nodejs`.
